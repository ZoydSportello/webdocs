# Join the Axelar testnet

To participate in the Axelar network, you set up a client that communicates with other peers and validators over the Axelar protocol. 

You can run this client on your computer or in a hosted Docker container. 

!> :fire: The Axelar Network is under development. **Do not transfer any real assets over the Axelar testnet.** Only use testnet tokens that you're not afraid to lose. Axelar is not responsible for any assets lost, frozen, or unrecoverable in any state or condition. If you find a problem, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/webdocs/issues) to this repository.


## Requirements and expectations

- **Time required** 
    - **Development** -- 45 minutes 
    - **Blockchain sync** -- 2-4 hours 
- **Deployment options** 
    - **Docker**
    - **Binaries**

### Prerequisites

Here are the prerequisites for both setup methods. You only need to install Docker of that's the setup method you want to use. 

|  |  | 
|:-|:-|
| OS | Mac OS or Ubuntu (tested on 18.04) |
| Architectures | arm64 and amd64 | 
| Container (for Docker setup) | [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). | 
| CLI tools | [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) (`apt-get install jq` on Ubuntu, `brew install jq` on Mac OS) | 
| Hardware | 4 cores, 8-16GB RAM, 512 GB drive. Recommended 6-8 cores, 16-32 GB RAM, 1 TB+ drive. | 
| Testnet faucet | [Axelar faucet](http://faucet.testnet.axelar.dev/). You need to fund your node through the faucet to connect to the network.  | 

#### Docker images

See [Testnet Releases](/resources/testnet-releases.md) for the latest available versions of the docker images:

- [`axelar-core`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/axelarnet/axelar-core) 
- [`tofnd`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/axelarnet/tofnd) 

You can save the latest version and to variables:

```bash
AXELAR_CORE_VERSION=$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axelarnetwork/axelarate-community/main/documentation/docs/resources/testnet-releases.md  | grep axelar-core | cut -d \` -f 4)
echo ${AXELAR_CORE_VERSION}
```

## Connect to the testnet 

To use Axelar's scripts and configuration templates, follow these steps:

1. Clone the [`axelerate-community`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelarate-community) repo to use the scripts and configs:

        git clone https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelarate-community.git
        cd axelarate-community

2. Checkout the tag that matches the cloned repo to ensure the scripts work with the deployment. Find the right tag at [Testnet Releases](/resources/testnet-releases.md).

        git checkout <release-tag>



3. Update the configuration with your public IP address. In the `join/config.toml` file, add your IP address to the `external_address` field, for example:

        external_address = "123.123.123.123:26656"

    If you don't know your public IP address, you can use [this site](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) to help find it. 
    
4. Set up port forwarding on your router. Axelar recommends forwarding ports `1317`, `26656`-`26658` and `26660`.

5. 


Run the script `join/join-testnet.sh`
